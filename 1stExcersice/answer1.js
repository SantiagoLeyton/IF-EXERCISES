    It works for these reasons:
    1. everything that is into this (/.../) delimit the regular expresion. 
    2. ^ is what it indicates that the validation start in the first character of the chain.
    3. [] defines the valid characters
    4. A-Z enables the capital letters from A to Z
    5. a-z do the same that A-Z but with the small letters
    6. zÁÉÍÓÚáéíóúÑñ also enables this characters
    7. the space at the end enables th space between words
    8. + minimun one character
    9. $ disables aditional characters after the enabled ones
